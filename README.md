# NLP-Deeplearning

## NLP on Disaster Tweets##

*This project is using differents deeplearning approach to classifie disaster tweets from others.*

You will find 4 notebooks inside that github:
* The preprocessing notebook
* The Lematisation approach notebook
* The LSTM approach notebook
* The transfert learning with BERT approach notebook

The dataset is from kaggle :
https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started

Because of the pool size, only BERT approach gave a result without overfitting (~80% accuracy)
Lematisation and LSTM model give something but with a very high overfitting level.
